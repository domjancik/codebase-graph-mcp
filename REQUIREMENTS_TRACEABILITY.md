# Requirements Traceability in Codebase Graph

The codebase graph system now supports comprehensive requirements traceability, allowing you to link requirements, specifications, and acceptance criteria to implementation components.

## New Component Types

### Requirements Hierarchy
- **`REQUIREMENT`** - High-level business or functional requirements
- **`SPECIFICATION`** - Detailed technical specifications
- **`FEATURE`** - User-facing features and capabilities
- **`USER_STORY`** - User stories in Agile methodology
- **`ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA`** - Testable acceptance criteria
- **`TEST_CASE`** - Test cases that verify requirements

## New Relationship Types

### Requirements and Traceability Relationships
- **`SATISFIES`** - Implementation satisfies a requirement
- **`DERIVES_FROM`** - Requirement derives from a higher-level requirement
- **`REFINES`** - Specification refines a requirement
- **`TRACES_TO`** - Generic traceability link
- **`VALIDATES`** - Test case validates a requirement/feature
- **`VERIFIES`** - Component verifies a specification
- **`CONFLICTS_WITH`** - Requirements that conflict with each other
- **`SUPPORTS`** - Component supports a requirement (indirect implementation)
- **`ALLOCATES_TO`** - Requirement allocated to a system/component
- **`REALIZES`** - Component realizes/implements a specification

## Usage Examples

### Creating Requirements
```javascript
// High-level business requirement
const businessReq = await createComponent({
  type: 'REQUIREMENT',
  name: 'REQ-001: Queue System Availability',
  description: 'The system must provide 99.9% uptime for queue operations',
  codebase: 'codebase-graph-mcp',
  metadata: {
    priority: 'HIGH',
    category: 'Non-functional',
    stakeholder: 'Operations Team'
  }
});

// Technical specification
const techSpec = await createComponent({
  type: 'SPECIFICATION',
  name: 'SPEC-001: CLI Queue Waiter Implementation',
  description: 'CLI tool must wait indefinitely until canceled with graceful shutdown',
  codebase: 'codebase-graph-mcp',
  metadata: {
    priority: 'HIGH',
    complexity: 'MEDIUM'
  }
});

// User story
const userStory = await createComponent({
  type: 'USER_STORY',
  name: 'As a developer, I want to monitor agent capacity',
  description: 'So that I can understand system load and agent availability',
  codebase: 'codebase-graph-mcp',
  metadata: {
    storyPoints: '5',
    epic: 'Queue Management'
  }
});
```

### Creating Traceability Links
```javascript
// Specification derives from requirement
await createRelationship({
  type: 'DERIVES_FROM',
  sourceId: techSpecId,
  targetId: businessReqId,
  details: { 
    derivation_reason: 'Technical implementation of availability requirement'
  }
});

// Implementation satisfies specification
await createRelationship({
  type: 'SATISFIES',
  sourceId: cliQueueWaiterId,
  targetId: techSpecId,
  details: {
    satisfaction_level: 'FULL',
    verification_method: 'Manual testing'
  }
});

// Test case validates requirement
await createRelationship({
  type: 'VALIDATES',
  sourceId: testCaseId,
  targetId: requirementId,
  details: {
    coverage: 'Primary flow',
    test_type: 'Integration'
  }
});
```

## Traceability Patterns

### Top-Down Traceability
```
REQUIREMENT → DERIVES_FROM → SPECIFICATION → REFINES → FEATURE
     ↓                           ↓                      ↓
ALLOCATES_TO              REALIZES                SATISFIES
     ↓                           ↓                      ↓
  SYSTEM                     COMPONENT              IMPLEMENTATION
```

### Verification Traceability
```
REQUIREMENT → VALIDATES ← TEST_CASE
     ↓                        ↓
  SATISFIES                VERIFIES
     ↓                        ↓
IMPLEMENTATION ← SUPPORTS ← COMPONENT
```

### User Story to Implementation
```
USER_STORY → CONTAINS → ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA
     ↓                           ↓
  REALIZES                  VALIDATES
     ↓                           ↓
  FEATURE → SATISFIES ← IMPLEMENTATION
```

## Query Examples

### Find all requirements satisfied by a component
```cypher
MATCH (component:Component)-[:SATISFIES]->(req:Component:REQUIREMENT)
WHERE component.id = 'component-id'
RETURN req.name, req.description
```

### Get implementation coverage for requirements
```cypher
MATCH (req:Component:REQUIREMENT)
OPTIONAL MATCH (req)<-[:SATISFIES]-(impl:Component)
RETURN req.name, count(impl) as implementations
```

### Trace requirement to test cases
```cypher
MATCH path = (req:Component:REQUIREMENT)<-[:VALIDATES]-(test:Component:TEST_CASE)
RETURN path
```

### Find conflicting requirements
```cypher
MATCH (req1:Component:REQUIREMENT)-[:CONFLICTS_WITH]-(req2:Component:REQUIREMENT)
RETURN req1.name, req2.name
```

## Metadata Recommendations

### For Requirements
```javascript
metadata: {
  priority: 'HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW',
  category: 'Functional|Non-functional|Constraint',
  status: 'Draft|Approved|Implemented|Verified',
  stakeholder: 'Business owner or requestor',
  rationale: 'Why this requirement exists',
  fit_criteria: 'How to measure satisfaction'
}
```

### For Specifications
```javascript
metadata: {
  complexity: 'HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW',
  effort_estimate: 'Story points or hours',
  assumptions: 'What we assume to be true',
  constraints: 'Technical or business constraints',
  interfaces: 'External interfaces affected'
}
```

### For Test Cases
```javascript
metadata: {
  test_type: 'Unit|Integration|System|Acceptance',
  automation_status: 'Manual|Automated|Partial',
  coverage_areas: 'What aspects are covered',
  preconditions: 'Setup required before test',
  expected_result: 'What should happen'
}
```
