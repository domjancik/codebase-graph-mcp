# Codebase Graph MCP Toolset Overview

## What is Codebase Graph MCP?

The **Codebase Graph MCP Server** is a powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a graph database for tracking software codebase components, their relationships, and associated tasks/goals. It's built with Neo4j for powerful graph queries and analysis.

## Key Features

### üèóÔ∏è Component Management
- **Track Components**: Files, functions, classes, modules, and systems
- **Component Types**: FILE, FUNCTION, CLASS, MODULE, SYSTEM, INTERFACE, VARIABLE, CONSTANT
- **Metadata**: Store paths, descriptions, and custom metadata

### üîó Relationship Mapping
- **Relationship Types**: DEPENDS_ON, IMPLEMENTS, EXTENDS, CONTAINS, CALLS, IMPORTS, EXPORTS, OVERRIDES, USES, CREATES
- **Dependency Trees**: Visualize and analyze component dependencies
- **Multi-level Analysis**: From individual functions to entire systems

### ‚úÖ Task Integration
- **Task Management**: Create, update, and track development tasks
- **Task Status**: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE, BLOCKED, CANCELLED
- **Component Linking**: Link tasks directly to specific components

### üìä Advanced Features
- **Change History**: Track all changes with full replay capability
- **Snapshots**: Create and restore database snapshots
- **Analytics**: Get codebase overview and statistics
- **Command Queue**: Real-time communication with external tools

## Core Components

### 1. Graph Database (Neo4j)
- Stores components, relationships, and tasks as graph data
- Enables powerful queries and analysis
- Provides ACID transactions and data integrity

### 2. MCP Server
- Exposes tools via Model Context Protocol
- Handles component CRUD operations
- Manages relationships and dependencies
- Provides task management capabilities

### 3. Command Queue System ‚≠ê
- **Real-time Communication**: External tools can send commands to waiting agents
- **Agent Pattern**: Agents wait for specific types of commands
- **Filtering**: Agents can specify what commands they want to receive
- **Queue Management**: Commands are queued when no agents are available
- **History Tracking**: Full audit trail of command execution

## Use Cases

### üîç Code Analysis
- Map your codebase structure and dependencies
- Understand component relationships
- Identify circular dependencies
- Analyze impact of changes

### üìà Project Management
- Track development tasks linked to specific components
- Monitor progress on different parts of the codebase
- Plan refactoring and architecture changes

### üîß Tool Integration
- Connect with graph visualizers for interactive codebase exploration
- Integrate with IDEs for real-time code analysis
- Build automated workflows with the command queue system

### üéØ AI-Powered Development
- Provide context to AI agents about your codebase structure
- Enable AI assistants to understand component relationships
- Support intelligent code suggestions based on graph analysis

## Command Queue System Deep Dive

The command queue system is particularly powerful for building interactive development tools:

### Agent-Based Architecture
```javascript
// Agent waits for specific commands
const command = await waitForCommand('my-agent', {
  timeout: 300000,
  filters: {
    taskTypes: ['EXECUTE_TASK', 'UPDATE_COMPONENT'],
    priority: 'MEDIUM'
  }
});
```

### External Tool Integration
```javascript
// Graph visualizer sends command to agent
const result = sendCommand({
  type: 'EXECUTE_TASK',
  source: 'graph-visualizer',
  payload: { taskId: 'task-123' },
  priority: 'HIGH'
});
```

### Real-Time Workflows
1. User clicks node in graph visualizer
2. Visualizer sends `EXECUTE_TASK` command
3. Waiting agent receives command instantly
4. Agent executes task and updates components
5. Changes reflect back in visualizer

## Getting Started

The MCP server is already configured and running. You can:

1. **Use MCP Tools**: Call any of the available tools through the MCP interface
2. **Run Queue Waiter**: Start an agent to wait for commands
3. **Explore Examples**: Check the examples directory for usage patterns
4. **Build Integrations**: Connect external tools via the command queue

## Example: Basic Workflow

```javascript
// 1. Create a component
const fileComponent = await createComponent({
  type: 'FILE',
  name: 'UserService.ts',
  path: './src/services/UserService.ts',
  codebase: 'my-app'
});

// 2. Create a task
const task = await createTask({
  name: 'Add user validation',
  description: 'Implement input validation',
  relatedComponentIds: [fileComponent.id]
});

// 3. Start agent to wait for commands
const command = await waitForCommand('validator-agent', {
  filters: { taskTypes: ['VALIDATION'] }
});

// 4. External tool sends validation command
sendCommand({
  type: 'VALIDATION',
  payload: { componentId: fileComponent.id },
  taskType: 'VALIDATION'
});
```

This system provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated development tools that can understand and interact with your codebase structure in real-time.
